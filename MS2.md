# Micro Sprint 2 – Design Thinking Process Practice

## Deadline
- **Date:** August 17th, 2024
- **Time:** 5:00 am (GMT-5)

# Deliverables

## 1. **Problem List**
   - **University gastronomic offer:**
      There are a lot of different places for eating breakfast, lunch, snacks, desserts or drink some coffee around the university. But, is there a place where to find the diverse offer? The answer is sadly negative. This hinders the possibility of people to know new places, prevents the gastronomic offer diversification and obstructs the growth of establishments with potential.
      Finally, nowadays the most powerful way in which a place can make itself known in the community is by voice to voice, using advertisements or being located on a concurrent place.
   - **Food Waste in Bogota:**
      Food waste is a major problem and one of the main sources of waste. Businesses in the food industry often produce more than they need to meet customer demand. To address this issue, there are two solutions that can be implemented. One is to change the business model to one where food is only prepared once an order is placed. The other solution is to sell or give away excess food. An app can be used to connect nearby consumers with businesses that have leftover food. This allows customers to "rescue" the food and prevents it from going to waste. The app can also help users find nearby shops, such as restaurants, cafes, and bakeries. While there may not be discounts on the food, the service is still developing and the concept of rescuing food is still meaningful.
   - **University Marketplace / Bartering App:**
      In the university communities there is usually a waste of resources, (i.e.) the academic materials required for the courses. Since frequently, these are bought for a class and once the course is over, they are never used again and instead they are kept and forgotten or thrown away. Additionally, it is sometimes hard to find these resources and buying them brand-new can be very expensive and many students are willing to use second-hand materials provided by their peers.

      The existing marketplaces do not provide the required alternatives to find the specific elements for the courses, at least not to the extent at which a university community itself can. Currently used alternatives, such as groups in social networks are not organized nor trustworthy enough.
   - **Student Initiatives App:**
      A very valuable dynamic of the Universidad de los Andes are the student initiatives, spaces created by students for students on topics that are not formally offered by the university. Mostly, these initiatives originate because a certain group of students wants to do some activity or sport or want to study a topic of interest in more depth, etc. There are many student initiatives within the university, some of which are better known than others. Several of these initiatives are promoted through social networks such as Facebook, Instagram or even WhatsApp, in groups where a large part of the uniandina community belongs. But sometimes these initiatives that are just starting, or that have already been consolidated for some time, lose visibility, causing that after a few semesters, several initiatives disappear. In fact, although some of these initiatives are still in force, many students interested in a certain topic do not know they exist.

      What is proposed is an application that brings together all these student initiatives, whether they are well known and consolidated initiatives, or those that are just starting, and that those who use this application can search the wide range of initiatives that exist, so that if they find a topic of interest, they can find in the application itself more details of what is done in that initiative (meeting place, activities carried out, etc.) and some contact information to be part of these groups.

      In this way, visibility is given to all initiatives, and these student groups can grow.
